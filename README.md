Given the backdrop of Blockchain Infrastructure, Cryto-Currency has emerged as an important technology that could be distruptive to the currenc established monetary markets.
While there are hundreds, indeed thousands of cryptocurrencies currently in the world, Bitcoin is one of the more well known.

How BItcoin behaves was the focus of our Project 3.

We utilized Deep Learning and RNN to impletment a forecast model.  Basically Vectors so that LSTM could manipulate and learn the data.

While we were numerically unable to forecast, this project does offer insight into the probable next steps to adopt for such an endeavour via discussion within out group and examination of the data in Tableau.
